The app will download all .CSV files on start up into "CSVFiles" folder from where the app is executed!

Debugging:
  Accesing the API by "https://localhost:44326/api/Crypto"
  or using "https://localhost:44326/swagger/index.html"
  

The API takes one Queary string which by default is set to "ALL/bch/bnb/bsv/btc/eth/ltc/xrp"
              which will generate/retrive all data for all the Cryptos
              if manually changed to one of the cryptos shown, it will only show the single crypto.
